# Навалом

# Ведение

Ты должен вести

* В танцах есть ведущий, а есть ведомый
* Она хочет, чтобы ты вёл
* Когда она выпендривается, она провоцирует тебя, чтобы ты начал вести
* В играх есть инициатива — нападающий и защищающийся
* В сексе один трахает другого
* В соблазнении один соблазняет другого
* Мальчики ведут, это естественно
* Девочек, которые это забывают, легко поставить на место, потому что инстинкты подсказывают, что так правильно
* Задание — разворачивать людей на улице

# Внушения

* Прямые — «подними руки!» + снял с неё футболку
* Завуалированные — «дует» (пошла окно закрыла)
* Метафоры — «было бы здорово свернуться калачиком на пляже» (захотелось поваляться и пообниматься)
* Подразумевание — «ты будешь ребристые или с пупырышками»

Ведение через внушения!

# Тотальность

* Полумеры не работают
* Если ты берёшься, до вкладываешься по полной и доводишь дело до конца
* Процент вклада равен проценту результата
* Попробую — не работает
* Чуть-чуть изменить себя невозможно. Есть несколько устойчивых положений — совсем лузер / совсем не лузер. Полулузеров не бывает. Ты либо тут, либо там. Если ты решаешь менять себя или свою жизнь — ты берёшь кувалду и хуяришь до катарсиса.

# Процесс обучения

* Первые 1000 подходов всем тяжело
* Ты должен сделать 1000 ошибок чтобы научиться
* Не факт, что тебе надо научиться и стать профессиональным соблазнителем. Никто не любит профессиональных соблазнителей, да и сами они не очень-то счастливы. Тебе надо сделать ровно столько подходов, чтобы достичь своей цели. Не больше не меньше.
* Никаких тренировочных подходов. «Я сначала научусь, а потом начну» — бред
* Никаких тренировочных женщин. Никогда не соблазняй кого-то кто тебе не очень нравится.
* Ты можешь искать девушку своей мечты, и по ходу дела трахнуть кого-то на один раз, это окей. Принцу иногда приходится перецеловать сотню лягушек, прежде чем найти свою принцессу.
* Ты понимаешь, для чего она годна — ни на что, просто поговорить, подружиться, заняться любовью, построить отношения. Для этого — ок. Дальше «для тренировки» — нет. Если по ходу дела «разглядел» — ок.

# Быть мужчиной, а не игроком

* Откуда битчшилды
* Почему общаются, но не дают телефон
* Почему дают неправильные телефоны
* Почему не берут трубки

Here are some reasons for why it's very stupid to come across as a player:

* Women will become skeptical and defensive. They will not let you have sex with them, let alone continue talking because being seen as a player is the same being a TRY HARD.

* Women will test you more because they can sense intuitively that you are playing a role or an avatar that is masking your true personality. These tests are aggressive: "Go away. You're a faggot. We're lesbians." etc

You want to relax people you are speaking with, and show lots of empathy.. so you don't get the defensive and bitchy reactions to begin with. Yes, you can plow, and remain unreactive.. but if you keep getting the same reactions from people then maybe it's YOU that has an issue, not her testing you for worthiness. Maybe you think you are coming across as alpha but, from what I see a lot in lairs, you are just a dickhead. People are trying to put you in your place, not see if you're cool enough for them to suck your dick.

Here's the second point. A woman is not not going to get down on their knees in a bar or during the day based on how much game you have, or how smooth you are. That's a total newbie fantasy. She's going to like you or dislike you based on what you are like as a MAN, not by how fluent you are in your verbal game. There's no direct correlation between who you are and what you say, and how much a girl likes you.. that's another part of the fantasy which you've marketed to believe since 2004.

What works in the real world, is demonstrating empathy, not intent. 'Pace her ongoing reality', as per NLP. Why this works is that she recognizes you as a GUY, not some player caricature. She can relate to it, and she feels like you GET HER. If you are all game game game like a machine gun, then she will be very aroused emotionally, but she isn't going to show up on a day2 or fuck you because there's no real human connection. That's what most guys are missing. It's much harder and more effective to make a girl feel SPECIAL ENOUGH that she can rationalize sleeping with you than how to make her laugh non-stop for 20 minutes.

It's more part of guy's social conditioning to be nice, polite and empathetic, and has a stronger connection in the girl's reality to fuck that guy. PROVIDED he isn't just a 'Nice guy', and combines it with negative expressions and physicality. You don't need to 'Run game', when you are like this, because she will be attracted if you spend enough time with her. It's about holding the frame internally that you are good enough for her, and letting that assumption shine through your personality. It's not compensating for anything, and it's patently obvious when you see a newbie try to cover up their mistakes by acting like a clown or a try hard.

# Learning Pickup

The first thing a newbie needs to understand about learning pickup is that it is a process. You’re going to build up a core of skills, and it’s only after reaching a certain level of competence that you’re really going to start being able to have fun, fulfilling interactions which may lead to a great long term relationship.

A lot of guys come in with the idea that they’re just going to learn a trick or two or a strategy to get this one girl that they’ve been going after, and once they do that they’re done – no need to learn anything else, mission accomplished. That’s setting yourself up for failure. Imagine standing up to bat before a major league pitcher and trying to figure out how you’re going to score a run. It doesn’t matter how good you’re coached about swinging, you’re not going to hit the ball. You probably won’t even swing until it’s in the catcher’s glove. And even if you did get a piece of it, if the ball isn’t immediately caught, you’re not going to be fast enough to round the bases.

Back in the old days we had the saying that to get one girl, you need to be able to get any girl. You need to learn to hit any pitch, you need to be run fast in general. If you want to attract that one girl, you really need to learn how to be generally attractive, and how to attract just about anyone.

**Focus on Process**

Easiest way to get discouraged is to go out, open a set, get ignored, and then slink back into some dark corner and vow never to approach another girl again. You got a bad result, and that deflated you. The problem is you focused on the result. I’m not going to say to not care about the results, because that’s a pretty superhuman bit of psychology there. It’s hard to control what you care about, but you do control what you focus on.

Focus on the process. If you’re intimidated by clubs or the thought of going out solo, then make your goal for the weekend to get to the venue Friday and Saturday nights. Once you’ve done that, make your goal to open a few sets. At this stage of the game, success really is determined just by putting forth an effort. Doesn’t matter if you get any hits, what counts is that you’re showing up to the batting cage and swinging at every pitch.

Even as you get more experienced, you should still focus on the process, because that’s the one thing you really do control. You shouldn’t go out and say your goal is to get 5 numbers. It should be to try to number close 5 girls. Don’t go out with the goal of making out; go out with the goal of going for the make out.

**What the Process Looks Like**

A lot of guys will hit plateaus. You’ll go out, open sets, get more comfortable, be able to open consistently, and then you’ll find you’re just not getting any better. The problem is that your process probably sucks.

When you go out to the bars and clubs, you need to be committed to putting in about 4 hours, and doing that two or three times a week. It takes a while to get warmed up – at least one set, but often two or three. It’s only after you’re warmed up that you start to make progress. Try going to the gym, stretching, and then going home. See how much stronger you get.

When you stick it out for hours, you get something that’s a bit like a runner’s high. You get in to the experience, you get comfortable with the surroundings. You feel good and want to keep going. And, you force yourself to open or else spend the next 4 hours bored out of your mind. There’s some nice motivation.

It’s also best to go out more than one night a week, preferably back to back if your schedule allows. You’ll have some residual state from the last night, get into the groove much quicker, and that will allow you to progress much more than you could have if you waited a week between outings. Plus, you’re not getting any younger.

**Be Patient**

This shit takes time. You’ll have some periods of rapid progress, and some plateaus. Sometimes you’ll even have setbacks, especially when things in the rest of your life interfere. And not everyone progresses at the same pace. Some people will learn a few outer game skills and become gurus almost overnight. Everyone starts from a different place, learns at a different rate, and has different goals. Stick with it, and approach learning pickup with the expectation that at best it will take about 6 months to really be decent, but that you should expect it to be closed to 2 years. Sounds like a lot of time, but compare it to how long it takes to get decent with a musical instrument, or to speak a foreign language. And, think about how long term the payoffs are. Not to mention, it’s not years of drudgery. You’re going to have a lot of fun along the way. And by fun, I mean fooling around with girls.

**Take Care of Your Shit**

Get a job, clean your room, get in shape, learn to dress (and smell) like someone girls want to have sex with.

This really cannot be stressed enough. The more you improve the rest of your life, the easier pickup will be. You don’t need to make fitness and bodybuilding your number one hobby. You do need to make fitness something you think about though. Eat healthier, exercise more. It’s really that simple. You’ve probably know lots of girl who’d be really attractive if they just lost a little weight. Not that much, maybe 10 pounds. It works both ways. You’ll feel better, project a better energy, your clothes will fit better, and you won’t have to quit having sex after two minutes because you’re not used to doing pushups. Also, drink a lot more water. 2-3 liters per day. Not only will you feel better, you’ll lose fat quicker, and your hair and skin will look better.

There’s too much to say about fashion for this post, so I’m just going to say to get a full length mirror. Look at yourself in it. Style is really personal and subjective, but get clothes that fit, and actually take a few moments to consider how you look.

You also need to keep your home presentable. Every time you go out, have a home you can bring a girl back to. If you know you can’t pull because your place is a mess, you’re going to have that in your subconscious and it’s going to hinder your game.

Finally for this part, get some hobbies. I read a lot, I write, I volunteer with a non-profit, I listen to Fresh Air, Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me and A Prairie Home Companion, and I cook a lot and like to learn about food and cooking. Pick whatever hobbies you want, but try to have something that is either hands-on or creative. It’s easier to attract girls when you’re an interesting person, plus you’re going to be much more relaxed and less needy when you have other sources of enjoyment in your life. Likewise, cut down the amount of time you spend watching trash TV, playing video games, and otherwise being completely unproductive. You don’t need to completely eliminate these things, but they shouldn’t be the biggest thing you’ve got going on.

A lot of guys have shit lives and are hoping they can find a girl who makes everything great. You won’t find that girl. She doesn’t exist. And, it’s not fair to expect a girl to polish your turd of a life. Become a whole person, one that’s just in search of another whole person to share the adventure with.

**How to Ask for Advice**

You’ll hit lots of stumbling blocks along the way, and you will need guidance. Unfortunately, 90% of the questions that get asked are completely idiotic. They make three big mistakes. They don’t give enough information, they ask unanswerable questions, and they lose sight of the process. Let’s go through these one at a time, starting with the second, then the third, then the first.

Unanswerable questions. “Why didn’t this girl call me back?” No one knows. We didn’t see your interaction, we weren’t there, we’re not in her head. There are a thousand different possible reasons for everything, and while experienced guys can offer some likely explanations, no one will ever be certain.

Asking about specific interactions like that is stupid because, and here’s the second problem, you’ve lost sight of the process. You’re trying to analyze one interaction when you need to be thinking in terms of bulk interactions. You’re asking how you could have hit this one pitch, when you need to be focusing on how to improve your stance and swinging motion. Think about your interactions in groups. Are you hitting the same problem over and over again? That’s what you should be asking about. Not how to solve one specific interaction that went poorly, but how to react to similar situations in the future so that you improve your odds. You’re not trying to hit that 1 ball 100% of the time. You’re trying to hit 50% of the next 10 pitches instead of 20%.

Lastly (but originally firstly), too many guys asking for advice about specific interactions fail to give all the details. Now, I’m not saying this because I want you to write a lengthy question with every tiny detail. Well, actually I do. I just don’t want you to submit it. Without the details, obviously no one can really give you good advice. But you’ll find that when you start filling in the details you’ll discover what went wrong. Once you know the basics, you’ll be able to think your way through these things. Take the time to do that. If you need to, write out a description of what happened, being as detailed as possible. You’ll almost certainly discover what the problem was. That’s incredibly powerful. There is nothing better for learning pickup than being able to answer your own questions, and when you’ve trained yourself to analyze your own interactions, you’ll get better at it, and you’ll get faster. You’ll get so experienced with it that you’ll be able to see what’s going on in real time, as you’re interacting with the girl, and that’s when your game will go to the next level. But, if you post bare bones questions and make other people trying to help you get vital information like they’re pulling teeth, then you’re just never going to get better. A big part of the game is learning how to think about your interactions, and you can’t get better at that by asking other people to do it for you.

If you can’t figure out what went wrong despite looking at it from every angle, go back to the second thing. Is this going wrong a lot? What do all those interactions have in common? There’s your answer. And if it’s not happening a lot, then who cares?

**Your Excuses Suck**

You can’t find time. You don’t drink (you don’t have to, btw). You don’t like clubs. You’re too ugly to ever love. Whatever. I’m not going to argue with you. You’re absolutely right. Enjoy never getting laid.

# Страх подхода

Hey Seddit, I put together this guide to Approach Anxiety, and I hope y'all will find it useful. It synthesizes a lot of the ideas going back the last 8 or so years in the pickup community, as well as a couple insights of my own. I'd appreciate any feedback you have, and if it seems that people like it, I'll work on making some more covering other topics.

Tamerlane famously said, “It is better to be at the right place with ten men than absent with ten thousand.” The contemporary version is this is the adage “You’ve gotta be in it to win it.”

Unless you are extraordinarily attractive and social proofed out the wazoo, you have to approach if you’re going to get anywhere. Or also you could be a woman. But other than that, you have to approach, and this is one of the biggest hurdles for guys. You get nervous, you’re afraid of how she’ll react, of what people will think when they see you get blown out, you’re worried your voice will crack when you start to speak, you don’t know what to do with your hands, and worst of all, you don’t have a freaking clue what to say. That’s Approach Anxiety in a nutshell. You feel paralyzed and end up standing in the corner by yourself, or with a group of other guys also suffering from AA in what’s known as “death row.”

Traditionally, the recommended practice for dealing with Approach Anxiety has been the 3 Second Rule. 3SR states that from the time you see a woman you want to approach, you have three seconds to get your ass in gear and approach. It’s a great mindset to be in when sarging, but it’s not really a cure for AA. It’s a bit like telling someone recovering from knee surgery that they need to run a marathon. Well, it’d certainly be great if he could run a marathon, but telling him to do it doesn’t really make him capable of it. The only way the 3SR works as a cure for AA is if you can manage to approach before all the anxiety builds up. If you can pull that off, awesome. But otherwise, we’re going to need something else. My approach towards AA involves two concepts, Routines and managing Self Talk.

**Routines**

First, the Routines. I know, I know, routines are very played out. Ever since Hollywood got slammed by Style clones running the best friends test, routines have been put in a box, and tucked away in the back of the closet where we hope to forget them. But routines do serve a useful purpose. Having a memorized line (and several memorized routines to use afterward) gives you one less thing you have to worry about when you approach, and since not knowing what to say is a huge part of AA, canned routines are almost like turning on God Mode.

The way to use routines is like training wheels. You’re not planning on riding around with them on all the time, and you know that you can’t ever compete in a race if you’re still relying on them. But, they’re there to let you get a feel for the bike, work on your balance, and be able to ride around instead of continuously falling over in place. It’s best to create your own routines, but if you have to, you can find plenty on the internet. Feel free to use them until you’re comfortable approaching, then take the training wheels off and go for more situational openers.

**Self Talk**

Next, Self Talk. This is a term from psychology, and it refers to the way we talk to ourselves in our heads, basically whenever your inner monologue is talking to you. The way we Self Talk can greatly influence our perceptions and beliefs about the world. It’s a useful thing to be aware of generally, but specifically applicable to AA. What a lot of guys will say when they have trouble approaching is “I can’t just go up and talk to a girl.”

Can’t. That’s bullshit, and we all know it. Your feet still move. Your mouth still makes sounds. The truth is that you are perfectly able to do it, but that you won’t. And that’s a very important distinction. If you’re telling yourself that it’s impossible for you to approach a girl, then no amount of telling yourself to nut up will help, you’ll just sit around waiting for the circumstances to change in a way that makes you think it is now possible. By saying that you won’t do it, you’re acknowledging that you can, and that the only thing stopping you is your stupid head. You’re no longer waiting for the world to change, and are instead are aware that all you need to do is put yourself into motion and it will happen. That’s a very powerful realization.

**Why You No Inner Game?**

Why not focus on Inner Game? Inner Game is certainly a very important concept in pickup, and no one can get by with just hours of memorized script. But, this isn’t the right time to focus on Inner Game. No amount of jumping up and down and telling yourself “My game is a ten!” is going to get you your first approach. You’ll still show up to the bar or the club or whatever, get your drink, and slink away into the darkness.

Memorize a few routines, and use them a whole bunch until you’ve opened 20, or 30, or 50 sets. Then it’s time to focus on Inner Game. Now you have something to be confident in. You know your feet work when commanded, and lines will come out more or less as intended. You’ll have seen most of the range of responses you can get, and there’s a good chance your worst blowout is already behind you. You have actual experience and some skill to have confidence in, and that Inner Game will be 1000x more powerful than anything some keyboard jockeying chode gets by meditating three hours a day and never approaching girls.

**Bonus Tip For Reading This Far**

One last piece of advice, and it deals with approaching rather than AA, but I think it works well here: Do not approach from the front or from the back. If the direction the girl is facing is 12 o’clock, approach from anywhere between 2 and 4 or 8 and 11\. You don’t want to sneak up behind a girl, that’s just weird, and if she’s with a group you’re going to force her to turn her back to them – this can be useful later on, but not in an approach, because she’ll feel awkward and her friends will immediately try to get her back.

As for not approaching head on, that’s because it’s a confrontational position. You’re not approaching her, you’re accosting her. It’s just our natural way of interpreting interactions; we stand side by side with our friends, and confront our enemies face to face.

The reason I put this here is because approaching from the side is one of the easiest things to do. It’s one of the few things where you can literally be told to do it and get it exactly right the very first time you try. Pretty much everything else takes practice, and lots of it.

I put this under AA tips because it’s a free tool in your skillset. It’s one thing you know you’re doing right when you approach, and that will help cut down on your anxiety.

# Как поцеловать девушку

Hey Seddit, I know what I'm writing in this post is pretty basic stuff for most of you, and very little of it is original; it's almost all synthesis of things I've learned over the last 8 years in the community. But, I've seen several posts recently (mostly on AskSeddit) that could have been easily answered with "Three Point Look," so I thought some people might find it useful to have this guide. Hope you enjoy.

Sha-la-la-la-la-la

My, oh, my

Look at the boy too shy

He ain’t gonna kiss the girl

Sha-la-la-la-la-la

Ain’t that sad

Ain’t it shame, too bad

You gonna miss the girl

When it comes to getting that first kiss, there are two questions that come up: How do I know if she wants me to kiss her? And how do I go about doing it, logistics wise? Fortunately, both of these questions have the same answer, the process of advancing towards the kiss increases the feedback you get from her about her receptiveness.

Disclaimer: This is not the only way to go for a first kiss. One time I was out at a rooftop bar in New York, talking to a girl for a while and she got a phone call. While she was listening to the other person talk at one point I just went for it and kissed her. She then continued her conversation, but afterward we spent the rest of the night making out. That probably won’t ever work again.

There’s more than one way to skin a cat, but what follows is the most basic, time tested, reliable method for separating a cat from its skin.

**First Contact**

[Note that this is starting with the assumption that you’ve already isolated her. I may do a separate post on that at some point, but it’s too much to include here. If you try to kiss a girl with her friends or your friends watching it’s going to be far more difficult.]

Going for a first kiss is basic light kino escalation. As you’re talking you make contact with her arm, her shoulder, her knee, the small of her back, her hand, non-threatening places you’re allowed to touch someone in public. You’re essentially probing for feedback. Does she pull away? Does the mood suddenly get awkward? Does she reciprocate with contact?

**The Voyage Home**

Once you know that she’s not turned off by physical contact with you, the next step is to close the space between you. This can be a little bit difficult if you’re seated because you have to lift up and shift your entire body weight to move; it’s really obvious and awkward, especially if you’re going to be making a bunch of small moves. Standing is much easier as people rarely keep their feet firmly planted, even when standing in place. It’s natural to shift your weight a bit and move your feet, so you can incrementally close the space between you. Standing also makes it easier to get feedback from her, so watch if she moves away to keep the same distance from you.

At this point you’ll also want to increase eye contact and slow the rhythm of your speech a bit if you’re a fast/nervous talker. Don’t be worried about silences here. Silences when you open a set are awkward. Silences when sexual tension is building just lets the air get even more charged.

**The Undiscovered Country (Alternatively: The Final Frontier)**

So now you’re in close. You can practically feel the heat coming off her body. It’s like holding two magnets close, you can feel the energy trying to pull them together. If you don’t feel this, it’s probably not the right time. Go back to your other attraction material, and come back to the kiss later.

But if you do feel it, now we’re in the last phase. It’s go time, and this is where the technology has gotten pretty sophisticated.

Traditionally the advice was the **Three Point Look.** You look into her left eye with your right eye, then down at her lips with both eyes, and then back up and maybe look cross-eyed into her left eye or something. Frankly, the Three Point Look was overly complicated and you’re going to lose the mood trying to remember the precise combination on that lock.

What worked in the Three Point Look was the quick glance down at her lips. You make eye contact, hold it …then as quick as you can look at her lips and then back up, re-establishing eye contact. You don’t sit there starting at her mouth like a fool, this is the briefest of glances.

The idea is that you’re allowing your eyes to betray your thoughts. She will notice what just happened, which means she’ll know what you’re thinking about. We’re all afraid of rejection, and by giving that quick look you’re “accidentally” making the first move. You give her the confidence to send some non-verbal cues of her own without fear of rejection, possibly the same Three Point Look, but more often Doggy Dinner Bowl eyes. (If you don’t know what that is, picture the pleading look on a puppy’s face when it wants to be fed.) Sometimes you won’t be entirely certain of her response, and no amount of advice will better inform you. What you’ll have to do is just get more experience so you can better read body language and facial expressions in these circumstances. Theory only gets you so far, you need field experience to master this stuff.

**90/10 Rule**

But wait, there’s more! The 90-10 Rule. This rule states that when going for a kiss, you lean in 90% of the way, and wait for her to come the other 10% of the way to you. I’m not a big fan of this rule, and prefer the 80-10-5/5 Rule. You go in 80% of the way, wait for her to go 10% of the way, then you split the remaining 5%.

I also don’t think either of these rules is something to worry too much about. It can give you confidence to have a game plan, but the biggest resource you can have is experience reading a situation.

**Mystery's Line**

Finally, there’s Mystery’s “Would you like to kiss me?” routine. It goes like this: “Would you like to kiss me?” Do not use the AFC version, “Can I kiss you?” Both can work, but Mystery’s line tends to be more successful. This is useful when you’re moving in closer but just hit a wall and can’t progress naturally, but there’s still that tension in the air. Don’t use this line if the situation feels cold, because you’re sure to get a No, and then it’s game over. Once she’s said it, she’s pretty much married to the position. Had you not asked, she might have warmed up to it, but now that she has said it she’s not likely to change her mind. When using the “Would you like to kiss me?” line you will rarely get a straight forward Yes. But the nature of the question creates a context where you both understand that anything other than a No is a Yes. You’re basically saying, “I’m going to kiss you now, so if you want to object, here’s your chance,” just with far more subtle and romantic wording.

So that’s pretty much all you need to know about how to tell if a girl wants to kiss you, and how to move in for it.

Oh, one last thing: It’s mouth-to-mouth. Just want to make sure that’s clear because I didn’t say so at the start.

# Стёб

Ah, the Neg Hit. If it’s not the most controversial thing in the pickup community, then it’s in the top two. But, I think Negs get a bad reputation because a lot of people misunderstand what they are and how they work. It’d probably be best if the term was switched to Teasing. That’s basically what it is, and the term makes the meaning more intuitive. But, for this guide I’ll stick with Negs.

**Anti-Supplication**

A Neg is the polar opposite of supplication, and so to understand how Negs work, you need to understand what supplication is. I’m sure most of you do, but I’ll do a quick bit on it for anyone who doesn’t.

If you listen to your mom, she’ll tell you that you need to buy a girl a drink and tell her that she’s pretty. It’s the strategy used by every supplicating chump, essentially trying to buy her affection with gifts, attention, and praise. Easy to see why women would insist this is the way things should be done.

Unfortunately, supplication tells a woman two very bad things. First, that she doesn’t need to do anything to get stuff from you, which makes her think “Why buy the cow when you’ll buy the cow for me, and then I can go fuck that other farmer who’s better looking than you?” Second, it tells you that you’re beneath her, and coming from you she has no reason not to believe it. Game over.

If you’re extraordinarily attractive, like 1 in 10,000 good looking, confident, and social proofed out the wazoo, the dynamics are different. But for the rest of us scrubs, that’s how supplication works.

**You are Equals**

A Neg works in the exact opposite direction of supplication. Instead of telling a girl you just met how pretty she is, you tell her that maybe if she fixed her mascara you might be willing to be seen with her in public.

Some people think the purpose of the Neg is to bring her down. It’s not. It’s designed to tell her that you’re both on the same level, and your interaction is one between equals. (If you think you have to bring her _down_ to your level, then you’ve got some Inner Game issues to work on.)

Being on equal footing is key. You do not want to come across as telling a girl that she’s beneath you. With the mascara example above, on the surface you’re telling her that her appearance is not up to your standards, but the subtext is that you really do find her attractive.

**Lowering the Bitch Shield**

In addition to putting you on equal footing, a Neg also serves to blast through her Bitch Shield. She’s been getting hit on by losers all night (and all her life), and is now just rejecting guys out of habit. By coming in with a Neg, you throw her off her game. Again, you’re not trying to bring her down; you’re trying to move her sideways.

Because you’ve come in with a novel approach, she can’t run her normal rejection script. Now she has to evaluate you as an individual, and not just part of the creepy masses. Plus, she’s less likely to try to reject you right away because she’s not even sure you’re hitting on her.

One potential hazard with trying to blast through a Bitch Shield is that she might not have one up. If she doesn’t, a Neg that hits too hard is going to have the effect of insulting her. Take a moment to observe her posture, how she’s dressed, the way she reacts to other guys around her, etc, before you go in guns blazing. And really, the safest thing to do is only Neg her once she’s done something to deserve it, such as run a Shit Test on you.

**Disqualifying Yourself**

The last thing a Neg does is it disqualifies you. It’s not the normal thing a guy does when he’s interested in a girl, so it sends to her the message that you’re not interested. If she thinks you’re not trying to hook up with her, then she’s not looking for a reason to reject you. That gives you a chance to stay in set longer and build attraction.

The hard part with disqualifying yourself is that the majority of approaches are pretty transparent. You typically don’t approach someone you’re not interested in, and she knows it. So, if you’re planning to use a Neg, you’re going to need an indirect approach. I’m not going to go too much into indirect approaches here, but I’ll give you two possibilities:

_Approaching her friend._ This is pretty old school technique: open the friend, rather than the target. Then wait for the target to try to extend her Bitch Shield to her friend, and fire off the Neg you’ve been saving for her.

_Using natural proximity._ You happen to be near each other on the dance floor, or are getting a drink from the bar at the same time. Basically you’re interacting by accident, not because you’ve approached her.

**Who to Neg and How Much**

Some guys learn about Negs and then go firing them off in all directions. That doesn’t make you a pickup guru, it just makes you an asshole. Remember, the purpose of a Neg is to declare yourself as equals and to throw her off her game. This is appropriate for a 10 with a stick up her ass who’s used to shooting down guys left and right. It’s not appropriate to Neg a normal, nice 7\. Your comment isn’t going to come across as a witty tease, it’s going to come across as an insult.

Save Negs for 9s and 10s. Or more exactly: Save them for girls who think they’re 9s and 10s. There are 7s out there who think they’re the Queen B, and there are 10s that aren’t particularly confident.

As for how many times to Neg, I know that Mystery recommends never going over 3, but I think it’s rare you’ll ever need more than 1\. You have to play it by ear though. If she’s opening up and talking to you like a normal human being, put the rest of your Negs away.

If she responds to you with a Shit Test though, put another Neg in the chamber and take aim.

**Reversing Direction**

After you’ve teased her a bit and gotten her to qualify herself to you, the final step is to reverse course: Pay her a genuine compliment. To her, a compliment from any random beta chode is worthless; they hand out compliments to anyone, and no one has to work for them. But from you, the guy who’s been teasing her, the compliment will feel like a reward she fought hard to earn. It’s not supplication if she earns it.

**A Few Examples**

Nice nails, are they real?

I think I saw some girls with more ridiculous shoes here, but you’re definitely in the top 2/5/10/whatever number makes sense based on the size of the venue.

I like your shoes, they look really comfortable.

With that wit, it’s a good thing you’re pretty.

You blink a lot.

You’re too much of a nice girl for me.

In one more drink I’ll be ready to hit on you.

You’re such a Miranda/Charlotte. (Use Miranda for a girl who thinks she’s hotter than she is and mistakes being a bitch with being strong. Use Charlotte for a classically pretty and very judgmental and prudish.)

My personal favorite: You must be a law student/lawyer.

[Edit: A comment asked about tips for creating your own Negs, and I think there's really one rule that will do most of the heavy lifting for you: Look for things the girl is probably not actually self conscious about. Fake nails are safe territory; the shape of her nose - not so much.]

Text game is weird because the technology is new, and it’s changing rather quickly. And it’s not just the technology that changes, but how we socialize with it. Digital natives will have a different attitude towards texting than Gen X. What’s congruent to the personality of a 38 year old will not be the same as what works for an 18 year old. That said, I’m going to try to give advice which I think applies to most people and will keep on being good for years to come.

**Good Text Game Relies on Good In-Person Game**

If you want to be good at texting girls, you need to be good at talking to them in person. And yes, rAFCs, I can feel your collective frustration. I know, you wanted the secrets to good text game because you can never think of what to say in person, but on the phone girls can’t see how nervous you are, and you can go on AskSeddit and get advice for what to text, and you were hoping that there was some magical text game advice that would mean never having to learn how to talk to girls in person.

Tough.

There are three reasons why good normal game is key to good text game. First, you just need to build up your experience and instincts when it comes to talking to girls. If you can’t learn to interpret what a girl is saying when you can see her facial expressions, her body language, and hear the tone of her voice, then you’re not going to be very good at figuring her out without the benefit of all those extra clues. Talking at a club is like walking through a minefield. Texting is like walking through a minefield blindfolded.

Second, like everything in pickup, texting is largely a numbers game. If you’re trying to figure out the perfect thing to text back to that one girl you’re after then you’ve already lost. You should be experimenting with different approaches for the five or ten girls you #closed over the week. And in order to get a lot of numbers to send texts to, you need to be good in the field.

Finally, everything you text will be read in the context of the girl’s impression of you when you met. If the girl just gave you her number hoping it would get you to leave and was intending on just ignoring you when you called later, then nothing you text is going to get you anywhere. She predetermined to flake, and you’re out of luck. But if you had a solid interaction and she’s looking forward to hearing from you, then your text game needs to only be to not say anything stupid and you’ll be fine.

**A Note About the Numbers Game**

Some guys view #closing as an end unto itself. If you’re very new to the game and working on getting your first number, or trying to figure out just how to get the words out without sounding like a moron, then that’s fine. But once you’ve gotten 10 or 20 numbers, you need to adopt Mystery’s philosophy that numbers are wood. They are, on their own, worthless.

If you walk up to a girl, chat for two minutes, and say “Hey, I have to get back to my friends, but I’d like to call you some time,” there’s a decent chance you’ll get her number. With the aid of a little bit of Red Bull and a lot of venue changing, in a single night it wouldn’t be that tough to get 10 numbers. And you’ll never hear back from any of them.

If you want to decrease your flake rate, the key isn’t good text game, but rather having a solid interaction with the girl before you get her number. Also, don’t immediately run away once you get her number (unless you’re actually leaving the venue), otherwise she might feel like you were just trying to be the cool dude who got some numbers, rather than actually being interested in her. Making her feel like just another notch on whatever you’re notching to keep score is a sure way to active her Anti Slut Defense.

A simple “Before I forget, let me get your number,” followed by another 5-10 minutes of conversation can do wonders for reducing your flake rate.

**Why Does the Convo Die?**

I’ve seen this a whole lot on the forums: You meet a girl, get her number, and then text her. She replies, you reply, and it goes back and forth more or less like a chat conversation for a while. And then the conversation just dies and she goes days without texting you back. How can she go from hot to cold so fast?

Do you have the friend or relative who will just not stop talking? If you answer their call, you know that you’re committing to be on the phone for at least an hour because they seem oblivious to the idea that you might have other shit to do with your time. Guess what, Mr. Text-Chatter, you’ve become that person.

She might have fun chatting with you that first time, but eventually she wants to get on with her life. When you text her the next day she’ll remember how much time you monopolized, and she doesn’t want to devote her whole afternoon to texting with you. So, she ignores you.

Limit yourself to no more than 3 messages with the girl per day, and you probably need to take a day or two off before texting her again. There’s no hard and fast rule, so you need to adjust the numbers a bit based on what you find working, but that’s a good baseline to start from, and certainly better than texting her 50 times a day every single day. The exception of course is if you’re actually in the process of making plans. If she texts back “Not sure where that is,” don’t be a shithead and not text back because you’re at your limit.

**When to Text**

You’ve met a girl, got her number, and now you’re wondering how long to wait until you text her. I take the same approach to this as I’ve used for knowing when to call her: When I want to.

The question really isn’t so much When, but Why. And that Why should almost always be to set up plans with her. Texting (or calling) just to chat is a sign that you’re bored and lonely. That’s not a great image to convey.

The big exception is that you should probably text her once either later that night or early the next day so that she’ll remember who you are.

A question I see a lot of is what to do if you get her number and then one (or both) of you aren’t available for a few weeks. How do you keep her interested in the interim? Unless you’ve already been out with her since your initial meeting, my advice is to not do anything. Wait until you’re back from your vacation or whatever, and then contact her. “I’m getting back in town tomorrow and have a serious craving for That Food Place.”

If you have been out with here, there’s really too many variables for generalized advice. Calibration, congruence, don’t screw shit up.

**Phone Game vs. Text Game**

Whether to call her or to text her really comes down to your style, what’s congruent for you, what you’re planning on saying, etc. So, there’s no real answer to whether you should call or text. What you need to know though is that calling is a more aggressive move.

These days people have shit for social skills and they tend to feel put on the spot when someone calls. This is true just as much for women. The phone rings and they think “Shit, I’m going to have to make sounds with my mouth! What do I do?!” So, calling a girl can make her very uncomfortable, which of course increases the chances that she won’t answer.

On the other hand, calling demonstrates that you’re not a wimp who is too afraid to pick up the phone and call a girl.

If you have good in-field game, this will be pretty obvious to you. If you go in guns blazing with a lot of teasing on a target who is smart and confident and can give it right back to you, you’re going to do pretty well. If you take the same approach with a girl who is very reserved, you’re just going to come across as an asshole. Same with phone vs. text, it’s all about knowing your target.

**Txtsp34k**

Yet again, congruence is king here. I write with full words, in full sentences, with full stops at the end. But, I’m also in a graduate writing program and have two articles published in academic journals, so it’d look stupid and incongruent for me to use text speak. Likewise, if you’re a freshman in college and try to emulate my writing style, you’re going to sound like you’ve got a stick up your ass. Do what feels natural, while also occasionally thinking about why you write the way you do, and what it conveys about you.

**The Final Word**

Stop trying to come up with the perfect text. The more you think about it, the more stressed you get, and the more likely you are to over complicate things and send a wholly inappropriate message. Just send the damn text and go do something productive with your time. Plus, the prefect text has nothing to do with the content of the text and everything to do with being sent by that incredibly charming guy she met a couple days ago.
